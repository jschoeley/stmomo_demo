This script illustrates how to use the [StMoMo](https://github.com/amvillegas/StMoMo) framework to forecast age specific fertility rates based on historical information on births and person-years exposure. We also illustrate how to implement a Lee-Carter variant with a parametric beta specification which can aid with convergence for difficult data series.
